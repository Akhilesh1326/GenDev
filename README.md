# GenDev
This project is a web application designed to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of traffic conditions in their city. 
It integrates with real-time traffic data sources to dynamically visualize traffic density, speed, and congestion levels 
across different city areas. Additionally, the application offers interactive exploration tools like heat maps, scatter plots, 
and time-series analysis for in-depth trend analysis.

Features:

Real-Time Data: Integrates with real-time traffic data feeds, ensuring users have access to the latest traffic conditions. 
(Specify the data sources you plan to integrate with)

Interactive Visualization:
Heat Maps: Visually represent traffic density across the city, with colors indicating higher congestion levels.
Scatter Plots: Explore correlations between traffic speed and other factors like time of day or weather conditions.
Time-Series Analysis: Analyze traffic patterns over time to identify trends and predict future congestion.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface that allows users to easily explore traffic data.
